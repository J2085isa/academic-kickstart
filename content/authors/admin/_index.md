Xuanchi Ren is currently an undergraduate student at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, supervised by Prof. [Qifeng Chen](https://cqf.io/). During 2020 spring, he was an exchange student in EPFL, where he was fortunate to work with Prof. [Alexandre Alahi](https://people.epfl.ch/alexandre.alahi?lang=en) and Dr. [Li Erran Li](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~lierranli/). He spent one and a half years as a full-time research intern in the [Intelligent Multimedia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/internet-media/) Group of Microsoft Research Asia from July 2020, supervised by Dr. [Yuwang Wang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/yuwwan/) and Prof.[Wenjun Zeng](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/wezeng/). He was also lucky to work with Prof. [Xiaolong Wang](https://xiaolonw.github.io/) at UCSD in the 2021 Summer. 

His research interests currently focus on computer vision and deep learning. He has experience in the generative model, disentangled representation, autonomous driving, 3D vision, video generation, and low-level vision.

He is expected to apply for Ph.D. starting from 2022 Fall. Here is his [Curriculum Vitae](http://xuanchiren.com/files/cv.pdf).
