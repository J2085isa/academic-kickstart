Xuanchi Ren is currently an undergraduate student in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. During 2020 spring, he was an exchange student in EPFL, where he was fortunate to work with Prof.[Alexandre Alahi](https://people.epfl.ch/alexandre.alahi?lang=en). He is a full-time research intern in [Intelligent Multimedia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/internet-media/) Group of Microsoft Research Asia from July, 2020, supervised by Dr. [Yuwang Wang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/yuwwan/) and Prof.[Wenjun Zeng](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/wezeng/). Up to now, he is working with Prof.[Qifeng Chen](https://cqf.io/) and Dr. [Li Erran Li](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~lierranli/) as a research assistant. He will work with Prof. [Xiaolong Wang](https://xiaolonw.github.io/) as an intern in 2021 Summer.

His research interests currently focus on computer vision and deep learning. He has experiences in  disentangled representation, autonomous driving, 3D reconstruction, video generation, human motion synthesis and low-level vision.

He is expected to apply for Ph.D starting from 2022 Fall. Here is his [Curriculum Vitae](http://xuanchiren.com/files/cv.pdf).
